# CatPhotoApp

This is my **first HTML project**, built while following the FreeCodeCamp curriculum.

## 🐱 Project overview
The CatPhotoApp is a simple webpage that displays:
- Cat photos and gallery links
- A list of things cats love and hate
- A form to submit your own cat photo

This project helped me practice:
- Basic HTML structure (`<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`)
- Using sections, lists, figures, and forms
- Linking to external sites and images

## 🚀 Live demo
